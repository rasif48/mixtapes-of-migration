<p>Yasmin, Obada</p>



<iframe title="حق العودة by Obada B Hassan" width="940" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F808425727&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=940&#038;maxheight=1000&#038;dnt=1"></iframe>



<p>This mixtape is based on the Palestinian Nakba in 1948 and, how Palestinians migrated from their original and homeland countries. Al Azieh Camp which is located in Bethlehem is our focus. The purpose of&nbsp;shedding the light on a camp is for the reason that all the citizens that live in this camp obviously are migrants. The main goal of this mixtape&nbsp;is to spread awareness about hurtful memories of Nakba which leads so many people to leave in Diaspora and with no shelter or food. This is a reminder for the existing Palestinian leaders that Palestinians and especially refugees will not compromise over their lands which is as valuable as their children. We will spread this awareness through this mixtape so more people will be able to listen to it. As we also believe that often more people will listen to music and interview as a voice more than reading an article or a book that speaks up in the voice of Palestinians, especially refugees. This mixtape will be available for every Palestinian and non-Palestinian particularly, for the upcoming generation that will shape our world in a better and more peaceful way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<iframe title="Killed in August - DLM by Deema Za" width="940" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F1027371628&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=940&#038;maxheight=1000&#038;dnt=1&#038;secret_token=s-sgeMxBJqDx1"></iframe>



<p>Killed in August by Dima, Leyana, and Manar (DLM) is a mix-tape re-narrating the massacre of Tal Al-Zaatar, a genocide committed against thousands of Palestinians in Lebanon, and is considered a human atrocity against innocent civilians including women and children, which took place after the siege of the camp for 52 days forcing its residents to eat dogs, cats, and even dead bodies to avoid starvation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>This mix-tape bundles together musical and non-musical tracks narrating the story of Tal Al-Zaatar. It begins with a song by Sheikh Imam under the name of Tal Al-Zaatar, which he composed to mourn the human atrocity and the betrayal of Palestinian refugees by their fellow Arabs, the perpetrators of the genocide motivated by religious bigotry that fueled the Lebanese Civil War, as well as their leaders who left them to face death and sacrificed more than 2000 civilian of the residents of the camp without giving it a second glance.</p>



<p><br>Following the documentary by the Syrian Political Encyclopedia which tells the political and the historical context of the massacre, Ahmad Azzatar -originally a poem by Mahmoud Darwish, is a track narrated by Marcel Khalifah in which he poetically describes the tragic events of the massacre, while the background music is a combination of a piece composed by Ziad Al Rahbani, additionally to violent sound effects mimicking those heard in wars, including bullets, bombing, and helicopters. The background music of this track portrays the struggle of refugees wherever they go, whether inside their homelands or in neighboring countries, they are subjected to discrimination, humiliation, and other horribles of war.<br>Lastly, we added a re-narration of the genocide, trying to conclude the chronicle order of events to make our audience aware of what the Palestinian refugees went through before, during, and after the massacre. We created this mix-tape to commemorate this very incident which we believe that no one should forget about and to represent the injustice which has become a part of refugees’ daily life.</p>

<p>Sariyah Abuzant</p>



<p><strong>The Struggle of Retaining the Identity of Palestine in the Past Century</strong></p>



<p>This mixtape is about the many faces of the Palestinian identity over the past century. Working on the idea that identity is made up of the values and beliefs that a person or community hold dearest, it intends to explore how the values, hence the identity, of the Palestinians has been challenged. These challenges will be referenced through music, poetry and sound bites, found on-line and in literature, that have been influenced through the course of the political, cultural and technological influences. It will include tracks from local and diaspora sources, that represent how each has held on to the Palestinian identity despite the influences mentioned above.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-soundcloud wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-soundcloud wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="I am from poem by Sariyah Abuzant" width="940" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F809965354&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=940&#038;maxheight=1000&#038;dnt=1&#038;in=sariyah-abuzant-909287796%2Fsets%2Fmix-tape"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>Aims:</strong></p>



<p>The aims of this mixtape are to help two kinds of audiences:&nbsp;<strong>Palestinians</strong>&nbsp;who need to evaluate the values and beliefs that make up their own identity, and&nbsp;<strong>for outsiders,&nbsp;</strong>to support the idea that the identity “Palestinian” has been imbedded in the history of this land, not just a term made up for “Arabs” to stake their claim on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Show how Palestinian values have challenged over the past 100 years.</p>



<p>2. Show how these challenges have rooted Palestinian identity.</p>



<p>3. Show that although Palestinian identity has changed somewhat, Palestinians are still proud to claim their identity, and cling to their values, beliefs and culture despite outside influences and migration.</p>



<p>4. Show the identity that has remained unchanged throughout the years.</p>



<p>5. Show that despite attempts to erase Palestinian identity, there continues to be a resistance against it through new and unconventional means, such as Rap music and comedy, that instills how important it is for the younger generation to claim and project Palestinian identity, as a form of resistance.</p>



<p>6. Show that although there are millions of Palestinian refugees in the world, many of them who have taken on another nationality, still refuse to give up their Palestinian identity, and take great pride in it.</p>



<p><strong>Research approaches/methodologies</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this mixtape we need to understand the struggles that have occurred, the changes they have created and the catalyst behind them. We need to link music, poetry, comedy, demonstrations etc. to the timeline of the resistance. This mixtape will be ordered chronologically, beginning in 1920’s until the present.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Odai Jodeh</p>



<p>Try to explain the suffering that a migrant might forcibly go through or even people who want to move to find a better life. It must be mentioned that it is difficult to understand the suffering that a migrant or refugee is going through because this suffering can only be understood if you have passed with such a position. Many people pass through moments that can be very difficult, and they may continue to live in these moments. Music may sometimes be a good example related to specific situations, and suffering may be described by linking it to a specific crisis. Also, some words may be present in songs that have meanings derived from the suffering experienced by people. Many thinkers may also help describe the crises that some samples of people go through, so listening to them may explain to you some of the suffering people are going through, such as refugees who have lost their homes and lands. The Palestinian people, the Syrian people, and many refugees around the world are going through very difficult moments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dina, Nardeen, Nura </p>



<p>Our mixtape will be focusing on identity, and what contributes to one’s identity. We will specifically be looking at the memories that reside within a Palestinians grandma&#8217;s mind, from there we will make tracks that represent parts of who and what she is. The purpose of this mixtape is to portray what kind of elements attribute to building a Palestinian grandma’s character. It will show elements of oppression, injustice, occupation, loss, victory, and joy. The reason we chose a mental space, rather than confining ourselves to a physical one, is to show how identity is built and some characteristics or things that are attributed to one’s identity cling on to them. By this, we are portraying the essence of one’s character by exploring their memories as if they were taking their last breath? What would they think of? Who do they remember themselves as? It is essential to listen to what attributes to a Palestinian grandmas identity since it is constantly being attempted to be erased and forgotten by the mass genocide that Palestinians undergo due to Zionism and the State of Israel.</p>



<p>Since we are trying to portray the essence of a strong Palestinian woman, our aim is to show the young westernized Palestinians who live in the global north, who have lost touch with their roots and identity. We would hope that this mixtape reminds them of the struggle Palestinians have to go through. To remind them that living in a western country does not mean they need to cleanse themselves of their Palestinian roots, especially not when the Palestinians living in Palestine undergo ethnic cleansing. This also to remind them of the beauty and strength it takes to be a Palestinian. To let them know that being Palestinian is not just a label for nationality but rather part of one’s identity. Further, this is to remind them of where they came from, as it will help refresh their memory of their history and, generally, show them the struggle of a Palestinian grandparent, in terms of what they had faced and still face.</p>



<p>This album is sequenced in the sense that it follows a Palestinian womens life, from her birth to her death. The songs are things she remeberes right when shes about to take her last breath.</p>



<p>Release date:1 May 1948</p>

<p>Layan, Rana, Hazar</p>



<p>This mixtape titled &#8220;A Glimpse Of Hope&#8221;, containing 3 songs by middle eastern singers, Faia younan, Julia Boutros, and Shabjdeed. We also made sure to incorporate poems by some of the most well known poets out there, one of them being one the most gracious Palestinian poets, Mahmoud Darwish. We also included a poem by Yousif Qasmiyeh, as a symbol of inspiration to all the people living under corrupt societies or citizens whose rights have been neglected. Yousif was able to stand against all challenges of living in a refugee camp, leaving the camp and continuing his education in Oxford university. This mixtape was made in the hopes of giving other nations going through political and social hardship, something to be optimistic about, and overall give them a glimpse of hope.</p>

<p>Savana Mjalli</p>



<p>Belonging has different meanings for all of us. What determines whether or not we feel a belonging towards a place or thing? And what does it mean to belong? This mixtape shows, through the use of interviews, the taxonomy of belonging, starting from confusion of belonging and what it is, ending in the realization that nothing belongs to you (spiritually).&nbsp;</p>

<h4>belonging (spiritual)</h4>



<p>Belonging has different meanings for all of us. What determines whether or not we feel a belonging towards a place or thing? And what does it mean to belong? This mixtape shows, through the use of interviews, the taxonomy of belonging, starting from confusion of belonging and what it is, ending in the realization that nothing belongs to you (spiritually). </p>

<p>Renad Issa&nbsp;</p>



<p>Palestine Is Our Homeland</p>



<p><br>This playlist constructs Palestinian vision towered their homeland, how they have eternal belonging to Palestine as their homeland. I’m focusing on how Palestinians linking themselves with their land even of the unstable political and colonial conflict in Palestine. The geographical focus of my mix tape is about Palestine and the Palestinian villages, which play a role in strengthening the link between Palestinians and their homeland even in the case of Palestinians who are living outside the territory of Palestine. The purpose of the mix tape is to clarify how Palestinians describing their connection with their homeland, which represent by the territories and the identity. <br>For the structure and context of the mix tape; the first track involves a poem for a Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, his poem called ”On this land”, it describes the value of the Palestinian land, the same track including a piece of music Called “Ommi”, which had been played by Marcheal Khalife a Lebanese composer and singer, he played the music by the Oud(Lute) instrument. The second track I’m narrating words written by Dr. Mohamed Kamel Doraï , With including piece of music from song called “Walking Tall” for Marcheal Khalife . The third track is an interview that I did under PAYCE(Palestinian American Youth Civic Engagement) program. My interview was with a Palestinian artist Lina abojaradeh, she was born in the USA but still has strong patriotism and affiliation to her homeland Palestine. The fourth track including various slogans, which used by Palestinian in protests, the music in the background is from a song by Fairuz a Lebanese singer, the song called “ Flower of Cities”. The last track is part of a song for Maher Zain a Swedish R&amp;B Singer, the song called” Palestine Will Be Free”.</p>
